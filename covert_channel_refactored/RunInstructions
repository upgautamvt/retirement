- First, set the input of the set_cpu function in both send.c and receive.c to two logical cores that belong to the same physical core.
The specific cores depend on your processor's topology (use lscpu -e)

- Next, compile send.c into send.s, modify send.s as per the described changes, and then compile it into the final send binary.
Repeat the same process for receive.c.

- After compiling, open one terminal and run ./receive > re.txt. In another terminal, run ./send.
Once execution is complete, you'll find the results in re.txt.

- Use the values in re.txt to set the appropriate threshold in result.c.
These thresholds are processor-dependent, but the relative timing patterns are generally consistent, allowing decryption to work across different devices.

- On AMD processors, the rdtsc instruction has lower precision, so the original eight-loop structure may not yield eight
distinct timing differences. However, at least four distinct differences should still appear, as explained in the paper
 “Microarchitectural Attacks and Mitigations on Retire Resources in Modern Processors.”
